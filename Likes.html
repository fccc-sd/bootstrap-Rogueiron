	<h3> Things I like </h3>
					<p>
						&emsp;Some things I do like are video games.Some games I have played recently are listed below.
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li> GTA 5 </li>
							<li> Home Projects </li>
							<li> Fortnite </li>
							<li> Apex Legends</li>
						</ul>
					<p>	
						Some other things I like is my friends, my family, And of course food. I also enjoy being around people, but
						sometimes I do need space. I do also enjoy adventuring or exploring new places and making new
						memories with both friends and family. My favorite food is sushi ever since I tried it I have loved it and always hope to get more.
						Another thing I like include making my own games this allows me to be creativly free.
					</p>	
				<h3> Things I Don't like </h3>
					<p> &emsp;I don't like a lot, but not because I don't like them, but because I don't do a lot.
						Some of the things I don't like are mainly just my big fears. One if not my biggest fear is of heights.
						My fear is so bad that I can barely go up a ladder without getting scared. This has also made me think its a phobia.
						Another fear of mine is snakes I dont like how scary they can be and slimy. I'm always afraid I will step on one and it bites me. 
						Last I really don't like frogs maybe its because the can jump and are also slimy. Ever since I can remember I just can stand frogs and I will yell and scream if one does come near me.
						Unlike the rest of my family there are foods I will not eat.One of those is tomatos I have tried many time but I can't eat them at all. Next is pickles same deal I have tried many time
						but I still don't like them. Other foods I dont like are condiments like mustard and ketchup. I also don't like trying new foods in fear I wont like them and never will.
