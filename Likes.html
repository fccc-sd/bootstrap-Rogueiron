	<h3> Things I like </h3>
					<p>
						I don't like a lot, but not because I don't like them, but because I don't do a lot.
						Some things I do like are video games.Some games I have played recently are listed below.
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li> GTA 5 </li>
							<li> Pokemon </li>
							<li> Town of Salam </li>
							<li> Apex Legends</li>
						</ul>
					<p>	
						Some other things I like is my friends, my family, Aand of course food. I also enjoy being around people, but
						sometimes I do need space. I do also enjoy adventuring or exploring new places and making new
						memories. My favorite food right now is sushi ever since I tried it I have loved it.
					</p>	
				<h3> Things I Don't like </h3>
					<p> Some of the things I don't like are mainly just my big fears. One if not my biggest fear is of heights.
						My fear is so bad that I can barely go up a later without getting scared. Another fear of mine is snakes.
						I'm always afraid I will step on one and it bites me. Last I really don't like frogs. Ever since I can remember
						I just can stand frogs and I will yell and scream if one does come near me.Unlike the rst of my family there are foods i will not eat
						one is tomatos i have tried many time but i can't eat them at all next is pickles same deal i have tried many time
						but i still don't like them.
