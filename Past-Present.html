	<h3> About my Past </h3>
					<p>
						In my past, I used to play sports Like Football, Wresting, Basketball, And Soccor. In the past, I hung out with
						my older brother a lot, but he moved away so now I don't see him much. I also used to be in a choir at my old school
						before I came to my new one to get involved in game design.
					</p>
				<h3> About Me Now </h3>
					<p>
						Now I am following my dream to become a video game developer by going to a trade school for game design
						and computer programming. My teacher is Mr. Geiger he is an amzing guy and has his own <a href="https://mrgeiger.com/">website.</a> 
						I'm also a video gamer who streams on twitch sometimes. One day besides game design
						I hope to be on a pro Esports team one day, even if that dream is out of reach. If I'm in Esports I will be in Esports Ohio
						See all the information on <a href="https://www.esportsohio.org/">The Esports Ohio website</a>.
